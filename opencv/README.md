# OpenCV camera examples with Coral

This folder contains example code using [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) to obtain
camera images and perform object detection on the Edge TPU.

This code works on Linux/macOS/Windows using a webcam, Raspberry Pi with the Pi Camera, and on the Coral Dev
Board using the Coral Camera or a webcam. For all settings other than the Coral Dev Board, you also need a Coral
USB/PCIe/M.2 Accelerator.
